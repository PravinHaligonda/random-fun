## Installation
Clone the repository and install any dependencies if required:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PravinHaligonda/random-fun.git
cd random-fun
```

## Usage
Launch the Jupyter Notebook environment and open any notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
From the Jupyter interface, navigate to and open a notebook (e.g., softmax_regression.ipynb) to explore or run the code.

## Featured Models
* Softmax Regression:
    A simple implementation of the Softmax classifier for multi-class classification problems.
* Multilayer Perceptron:
    A Multilayer perceptron using Sigmoid Output layer and MSE loss function
